# Multi-PRIME-Model
# 'Multimodal Physically-Based Root Water Uptake Isotope Mixing Estimation'

The Multi-PRIME model combines a semi-nonparametric, continuous, multimodal probability density function for root water 
uptake with site physical data in a process-based linear mixing framework, written in MatLab language.

# Program Files
The "Multi-PRIME-Model" file contains the Multi-PRIME main program.

The "Multi-PRIME input data" files contain organized sample data from the Nisbet Provincial 
Forest, Saskatchewan, Canada from August 13, 22, 29, and September 4, 2019.

For comparison of the mixing model MixSIAR to Multi-PRIME, additional files are included:

The "MixSIAR_model_" files contain R scripts for MixSIAR models.

The MixSIAR input data are contained in the "_source", "_consumer", and "_discrimination" files.
