# Multi-PRIME-Model
# 'Multimodal Physically-Based Root Water Uptake Isotope Mixing Estimation'

The Multi-PRIME model combines a semi-nonparametric, continuous, multimodal probability density function for root water 
uptake with site physical data in a process-based linear mixing framework, written in MatLab language.

# Program Files
The "Multi-PRIME-Model" file contains the main program.

The "Multi-PRIME input data" files contain organized sample data from the Nisbet Provincial 
Forest, Saskatchewan, Canada from August 13, 22, 29, and September 4, 2019.
